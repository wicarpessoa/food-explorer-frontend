# Api food explorer

This API server is designed to support a restaurant's web client. It allows users to log in as either administrators or clients, unlocking different features. For clients, this includes authenticating their accounts, viewing dishes, and soon they'll be able to mark favorite dishes and place orders. Admins have more control – they can create and delete dishes, upload images, and manage orders (coming soon). In short, this API server makes it easy for both clients and admins to interact with the restaurant's offerings and services.
